# Customer-Segmentation

What caught my attention with this dataset is due to the usage of collected data that we don't pay any attention to but is used by companies to get a better understanding of their consumers spending habits and cater a plan to get their customers to come in more by providing their specific needs and concerns.

# Methodology
* Dimensional Reduction PCA vs t-SNE
* K-Means
* Agglomerative Clustering

# Data
Data was pulled from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)

# Conclusion

t-SNE performed better than PCA and by exploring it further with different clustering techniques, K-Means came up with a better solution. We were able to identify 4 different groups with similar spending habits
